# Cursor Project Rules: LLM-Powered LinkedIn Job Search App

- Use FastAPI (Python) for backend APIs and LLM integration.
- Use React (TypeScript) for frontend UI.
- Integrate OpenAI (or other LLM) via backend utility (`llm.py`).
- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code.
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code and use functional React components.
- Document all LLM prompt strategies and API endpoints.
- All AI/LLM features must be accessible via backend endpoints, not directly from frontend.
- Ensure user data privacy and secure token handling.
- Use bugtracking.md for all error/bug reports.
- Keep documentation up to date with any new LLM/AI features or changes.
