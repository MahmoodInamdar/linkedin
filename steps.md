# Progress Log — Today's Steps

## Date: 11th July

### Steps Completed
- Created backend modular folders and files for OAuth, LinkedIn API, models, and profile endpoints
- Implemented `/auth/linkedin` and `/auth/callback` endpoints for LinkedIn OAuth
- Added service to fetch LinkedIn profile and email using access token
- Defined SQLAlchemy models for User and Profile
- Scaffolded profile API endpoint (to be connected to DB)
- Wired up routers in FastAPI app
- Provided instructions for running the backend and setting up environment variables
- Reviewed all config and code locations for user-specific information

## Tomorrow's Plan: Backend Completion (Detailed)

### 1. **Complete OAuth Flow and Data Storage**
- Update `/auth/callback` to:
  - Use the access token to fetch the user's LinkedIn profile and email (via `services/linkedin.py`)
  - Store user and profile data in the database (using SQLAlchemy models)
  - Return a success response or redirect to a dashboard page

### 2. **Profile API Integration**
- Update `/profile` endpoint to:
  - Retrieve the authenticated user's profile data from the database
  - Return the profile as JSON

### 3. **Database Setup and Testing**
- Initialize the SQLite database and create tables (run migrations or use SQLAlchemy's `create_all`)
- Test the full flow:
  - Authenticate via LinkedIn
  - Fetch and store profile data
  - Retrieve profile data via API

### 4. **Error Handling and Security**
- Add error handling for failed LinkedIn API calls, missing data, or DB errors
- Ensure sensitive data (tokens, secrets) is never exposed in API responses
- Validate and sanitize all inputs

### 5. **Documentation and Code Comments**
- Document all endpoints and services
- Add comments to clarify logic and flow
- Update `steps.md` and `bugtracking.md` with any issues or fixes

**Goal for Tomorrow:**
- End-to-end backend flow: LinkedIn login → fetch & store profile → retrieve profile via API
- Robust, secure, and well-documented backend ready for frontend integration
