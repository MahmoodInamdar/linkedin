# Implementation Steps (with OpenAI/LLM Integration)

## 1. Project Initialization
- Set up `/backend` (FastAPI) and `/frontend` (React/TypeScript) directories.
- Configure environment variables for LinkedIn and OpenAI API keys.

## 2. LinkedIn OAuth & Data Fetching
- Register LinkedIn app, obtain Client ID/Secret.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 in FastAPI (`/auth/linkedin` endpoint).
- Fetch profile data (skills, experience, education) using LinkedIn API.
- Store user and profile data in SQLite (SQLAlchemy models).

## 3. LLM Integration (OpenAI/Other)
- Install OpenAI Python SDK (`pip install openai`).
- Create `llm.py` utility for calling OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, function calling for job/skill analysis and cover letter generation).
- Add FastAPI endpoints for LLM-powered features:
  - `/analyze_job` — Accepts job description, returns extracted requirements and suggestions.
  - `/optimize_profile` — Compares user profile to job, returns optimization tips.
  - `/generate_cover_letter` — Accepts job description and user profile, returns a personalized cover letter.
- Secure API keys and handle errors robustly.

## 4. Job Application Tracker
- Extend `models.py` to include a `JobApplication` model (fields: job title, company, status, date applied, notes, etc).
- Add backend endpoints to create, update, list, and delete job applications.
- Implement frontend page to add/view/update job applications, with status tracking.

## 5. Cover Letter Generator
- Add frontend UI to request a cover letter for a job (from job tracker or job analysis page).
- Display generated cover letter in a modal or dedicated page, with options to copy/download.

## 6. Frontend Development
- Implement login with LinkedIn (redirect to backend OAuth endpoint).
- Dashboard: Display fetched profile data.
- Job Analysis: Text area for job description, submit to `/analyze_job`.
- Profile Optimizer: Show LLM-generated suggestions.
- Job Tracker: Table/list of job applications, add/update status, link to cover letter generation.
- Cover Letter Generator: UI to request and display cover letters.

## 7. Testing & Documentation
- Test OAuth, data fetching, LLM endpoints, job tracker, and cover letter generator.
- Log bugs in `bugtracking.md`.
- Document API endpoints, user flow, and LLM prompt strategies.
